Catching Errors Sooner: Code Quality Check
    - Static Code Analysis
        -- Any checks on raw code
        -- Static tests can check for style, and syntax issues, catch potential versions conflicts,
        and even scan dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
        -- Static tests run can run before time-consuming build jobs so they can allow workflows to
        fail fast and save time.
     - Linting job to execute in wofkflow for static code analysis
         -- In attached "test.yaml" lint job is added to catch errors sooner.
