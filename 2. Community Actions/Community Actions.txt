What are community Actions?
- Community Actions are prepackaged Actions or reusable templates for different use cases.
- These actions are created by Github, partners, vendors to support their platforms, and
the community ofcourse.
- Community actions are free to use and we can fork them and customize them for use as they
are open source.

Finding the right action:
    - In Github Marketplace we can filter by publisher, category, and keywords.
    - We also can search for ations on Goolge.
Examples:
    - Checkout Actions
    - Package Actions
    - Deploy Actions
    - Build Actions
