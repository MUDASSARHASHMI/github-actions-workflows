Uploading to AWS:
- Configuring AWS Access
- Using Github Secrets
- Step Breakdown

## Configuring AWS Access
There are two approaches to make it work with AWS:
    -- DYI approach like below for new section in Github Actions:
...
    - name: Configuring AWS Manually
    run: curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
    - name: Unzip AWS CLI
    run: unzip awscliv2.zip
    - name: Install AWS CLI
    run: sudo ./aws/install
    - name: Configure AWS CLI
    run: |
        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${{ secrets.AWS_DEFAULT_REGION }}
...
    -- Second option is to use community actions where as a single step we provide 
    credentials to community action. Rest will be handled by the community action 
    itself.
...
- name: Confugure AWS CLI
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_DEFAULT_REGION }}
...
## upload the artifact
upload:
  - runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
         - name: Upload to AWS S3
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
            with:
                name: zipped-bundle
         - name: AWS credentials
           uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
           with:
             aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
             aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
             aws-region: us-east-1
         - name upload to s3
           run: aws s3 cp ${{ github.sha }}.zip s3://mys3bucketforgithubactions/${{ github.sha }}.zip
...
With this we've created a build and then we were able to upload it to AWS S3 bucket.
