Getting Running with Runners:
- What is Runner:
    -- A virtual machine where jobs defined in a workflow are run
    -- Runners can be hosted on:
        --- Linux
        --- Windows
        --- MacOS
        --- Self-hosted
- What is a custom Runner:
    -- A custom runner is a runner that we host ourselves.
    -- It can be any OS, datacenter cloud or workstation.
    -- In a custom runner we are responsible for security, patching, and updates.
- Why use custom Runners?
    -- A custom Runner is useful if our organization is ruuning it on Github Enterprice
    which is a licensed version of Github. This is common to organization with strong
    security and compliance requirements.
    -- Wen we use Github Enterprise, we can deploy it to private network to prevent
    unauthorize access to our source code.
    -- Github Enterprise do not have access to Github managed runners -- it can perform
    actions on Github intance but setting up runners will save a lot of pain.
    -- But there are use cases where we can run custom Runners without Github 
    Enterprise.
    Github does support manageability with secrets. We can use secrets to store
    credentials and other sensitive information.
    -- But there are scenarios where we don't want Github to access our production
    environments and we want to run our own runners.
    -- In order to cater monitoring requirements with extra visibility of our runners
    we can use custom runners.
    -- Another reason why we want to utilize our custom runner is cost management.
    -- Cloud providers have sustained use and reserved discount rates. Enterprises
    sometimes get bulk discounts. Depending on costs in our region, it may be cost
    effective.
    -- Custom runners as a service are assigned at the job level, so we could set up a
    workflow to create a custom runner, complete the bulk of the job on the custom 
    runner and tear down the custom runner.
