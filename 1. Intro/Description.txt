Github Actions:
- A countinuous integration solution
    -- Can trigger workflows based on pushes, pull requests, and other events to 
    execute, build, test and deploy tasks.
- A managed Service
    -- Hosted on GitHub
    -- Github manages the underlying resources, so there is no configuring, patching 
    and updating of infrastructure (unless we want to)
    -- Free for public repositories
    -- Paid for private repositories
- Supported by Community Libraries:
    -- Community actions let 3rd parties and individual contributors publish reusable
    solutions to common use cases.
- Anatomy of Actions:
    -- Workflow:
        --- A workflow is collection of jobs that run based on a specific trigger.
        Conceptually, a workflow is a CI pipeline. Workflows are defined in YAML files.
    -- Runner:
        --- A runner is a compute machine where workflows are executed. These can be
        Github-managed runners or custom runners.
    -- Job:
        --- A job is a set of steps that executes in a single runner workspace.
    -- Step:
        --- A step is the lowest unit of functionality for Github Actions. It can be a
        command, a script, a Javascript file, a Docker file, or a community action.
