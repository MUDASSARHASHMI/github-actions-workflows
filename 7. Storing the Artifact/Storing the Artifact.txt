Storing the Artifact:
After we've built our package we need to store the artifacts somehwere so that we can use them
later on. We can use the Github Packages to store our artifacts.
- What is Github Packages:
    -- Github Packages is a package
    hosting service that allows you to host your packages privately or publicly and use packages
    as dependencies in your projects.
    -- Also there are some other solutions beside Github Packagessolutions to store the
        artifacts:
        --- Sonatype Nexus
        --- JFrog Artifactory
        --- Cloud Storage Bucket (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage)
    -- Github Packages is storage solution for artifacts that is integrated with Github.
    -- Github Packages is managed by RestAPIs with programmatic access for easy integration
    into automated systems.
    -- Private repositories are allowed free storage and transfer, but are builled for
    exceeding the threshold.
    -- Github Package support includes:
        --- Docker
        --- Maven (For Java APPS)
        --- npm
        --- NuGet (.NET)
        --- RubyGems
        --- Apache Maven
        --- Gradle (Gradel Dependencies for Java Apps)
        --- Conan
        --- npm
        --- Python
        --- RedHat
        --- Docker
        --- Helm
        --- Universal
    -- If our artifact is not on the list we still can store it as "release asset".
