Testing Our Function:
    - There are lots of testing tools and frameworks for functional testing
    - We will invoke our testing functions with test payloads and check the results
    - We will submit multiple test cases to ensure that our function can handle more than
    one input
    - To submit multiple test cases we will use Matrices
    - Matrices are a way to submit multiple test cases to a function with a single call
    - We can stack matrices for example for a Java version and OS version or a Java version
    or a Docker version. That way we can create wide range of test cases.
    - This covers a lot of ground by submitting multiple values to single matrices.
