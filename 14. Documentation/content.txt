Adding Documentation:
- CI more than just build
    - Update Docs:We can also automate documentation in Github Actions. This way docs get updated with
    every push or change happens to the code base.
    - Update Tickets: We can manage tickets with succeeded release to automatically close
    all the tickets associated to that branch.
    - Automate Sending Emails/Marketing Content (If Opensource: We can automatically trigger
    emails based on actions, releases or failure to concened parties.
    - Run Analytics: We can even track overall application bottlenecks to figure what parts
    took long to resolve that may require attention or actions for future.
    - Publish message to queue: We can publish messages to a queue to trigger other actions
    and any number of entities can subscribe to that queue to perform their own actions.
- Github Pages
    - Github provides free public website hosting like s3 bucket
    - For static sites it supports any static site that can be deployed JS frameworks,
    plain HTML, and tools like Jekyll for free.
    - To configure free static site we simple create a desgnated branch name that is usually
    "gh-pages" and point to an index.html file and Github will serve 0that or any asoociated
    content as a website.
- What is pages good for?
    - We will use hosting service for our documentation and we have framekworks like MkDocs
    or Sphinx that does not require a whole lot code to serve documentation site online.
    - We can also use it for our personal website or portfolio.
    - We can use it for test results ans some test output to a HTML file so we can turn our
    pages to a dashboard to present any kind of data we like.
    - We can use Github pages for project roadmaps to let users or all parties to see what
    features are on the horizen.
